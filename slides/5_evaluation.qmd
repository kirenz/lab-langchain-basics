# LangChain: Evaluation

Example generation, Manual evaluation (and debuging), LLM-assisted evaluation & LangChain evaluation platform

# Setup

## Python

```{python}
from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAEvalChain
import langchain
from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAGenerateChain
from langchain.vectorstores import DocArrayInMemorySearch
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
from langchain.document_loaders import CSVLoader
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
import datetime
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
```

# Q and A Application

## Load data

```{python}
file = '../data/OutdoorClothingCatalog_1000.csv'
loader = CSVLoader(file_path=file)
data = loader.load()
```

- Vector store

. . .

```{python}
index = VectorstoreIndexCreator(
    vectorstore_cls=DocArrayInMemorySearch
).from_loaders([loader])
```

## Retrieval QA chain

```{python}
llm_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0, model=llm_model)

qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=index.vectorstore.as_retriever(),
    verbose=True,
    chain_type_kwargs={
        "document_separator": "<<<<>>>>>"
    }
)
```

# Test Datapoints Manually

- We use our data and come up with relevant questions

## Datapoint 1 {.smaller}

```{python}
data[10]
```

- `Output`: Document(page_content=": 10\nname: Cozy Comfort Pullover Set, Stripe\ndescription: Perfect for lounging, this striped knit set lives up to its name.

## Datapoint 2 {.smaller}

```{python}
data[11]
```

- `Output`: Document(page_content=': 11\nname: Ultra-Lofty 850 Stretch Down Hooded Jacket\ndescription: This technical stretch down jacket from our DownTek collection is sure to keep you warm and comfortable with its full-stretch construction providing exceptional range of motion. With a slightly fitted style that falls at the hip and best with a midweight layer, this jacket is suitable for light activity up to 20° and moderate activity up to -30°. The soft and durable 100% polyester shell offers complete windproof protection and is insulated with warm, lofty goose down. Other features include welded baffles for a no-stitch construction and excellent stretch, an adjustable hood, an interior media port and mesh stash pocket and a hem drawcord. Machine wash and dry. Imported.', metadata={'source': '../data/OutdoorClothingCatalog_1000.csv', 'row': 11})

## Hard-coded example questions

```{python}
examples = [
    {
        "query": "Do the Cozy Comfort Pullover Set\
        have side pockets?",
        "answer": "Yes"
    },
    {
        "query": "What collection is the Ultra-Lofty \
        850 Stretch Down Hooded Jacket from?",
        "answer": "The DownTek collection"
    }
]
```


# LLM-Generated examples

- Automate evaluation with a llM

## QAGenerateChain

- Generate questions and answer pairs

```{python}
example_gen_chain = QAGenerateChain.from_llm(ChatOpenAI(model=llm_model))
```

. . .

- Create dictionary with question and answer pair

```{python}
# the warning can be safely ignored
new_examples = example_gen_chain.apply_and_parse(
    [{"doc": t} for t in data[:5]]
)
```

## New examples

```{python}
new_examples[0]
```

- `Output`: {'query': "What is the weight of one pair of Women's Campside Oxfords?",
 'answer': "The approximate weight of one pair of Women's Campside Oxfords is 1 lb. 1 oz."}

# QA Chain

## Combine examples

```{python}
examples += new_examples
```

. . .

```{python}
qa.run(examples[0]["query"])
```

- `Output`: 'Yes, the Cozy Comfort Pullover Set does have side pockets.'

- Very litte information about the process in the output

## Langchain debug

- We set `.debug=True`to get more information

. . .

```{python}
langchain.debug = True
```

- Rerun the same application and take a look at your output

. . .

```{python}
qa.run(examples[0]["query"])
```

. . .

## Turn of debug mode

```{python}
# Turn off the debug mode
langchain.debug = False
```


## Limitations

- Only possible for relatively simple applications
- In the next section, we take a look at an automated approach

# LLM Assisted Evaluation

Let's use a LLM for semantic evaluation

## QAEvalChain

- Get predictions for our examples

. . .

```{python}
predictions = qa.apply(examples)
```


. . .

- Create chain with LLM

```{python}
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=llm_model)

eval_chain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)
```

- Call evaluate

. . .

```{python}
graded_outputs = eval_chain.evaluate(examples, predictions)
```

## QAEvalChain

- Loop through examples

```{python}
for i, eg in enumerate(examples):
    print(f"Example {i}:")
    print("Question: " + predictions[i]['query'])
    print("Real Answer: " + predictions[i]['answer'])
    print("Predicted Answer: " + predictions[i]['result'])
    print("Predicted Grade: " + graded_outputs[i]['text'])
    print()
```

. . .

```markdown

Example 0:
Question: Do the Cozy Comfort Pullover Set        have side pockets?
Real Answer: Yes
Predicted Answer: Yes, the Cozy Comfort Pullover Set does have side pockets.
Predicted Grade: CORRECT

Example 1:
Question: What collection is the Ultra-Lofty         850 Stretch Down Hooded Jacket from?
Real Answer: The DownTek collection
Predicted Answer: The Ultra-Lofty 850 Stretch Down Hooded Jacket is from the DownTek collection.
Predicted Grade: CORRECT

Example 2:
Question: What is the weight of one pair of Women's Campside Oxfords?
Real Answer: The approximate weight of one pair of Women's Campside Oxfords is 1 lb. 1 oz.
Predicted Answer: The weight of one pair of Women's Campside Oxfords is approximately 1 lb. 1 oz.
Predicted Grade: CORRECT

Example 3:
Question: What are the dimensions of the medium-sized Recycled Waterhog Dog Mat, Chevron Weave?
Real Answer: The dimensions of the medium-sized Recycled Waterhog Dog Mat, Chevron Weave are 22.5" x 34.5".
Predicted Answer: The dimensions of the medium-sized Recycled Waterhog Dog Mat, Chevron Weave are 22.5" x 34.5".
Predicted Grade: CORRECT

Example 4:
...
Real Answer: The fabric composition of the EcoFlex 3L Storm Pants is 100% nylon, exclusive of trim.
Predicted Answer: The fabric composition of the EcoFlex 3L Storm Pants is 100% nylon, exclusive of trim.
Predicted Grade: CORRECT
