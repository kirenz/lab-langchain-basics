Welcome to the lab *Langchain Basics* 

![](/images/logo.png){width="60%"}


In this lab you will gain skills in expanding the use cases and capabilities of language models in application development using the LangChain framework.


::: {.callout-important}
Make sure you meet all the [requirements](/requirements.qmd) and have read the lecture [slides](/slide.qmd) before you start with the [assignments](/assignments.qmd) 
:::

In this lab you will learn and get experience with the following topics:

- **Models, Prompts and Parsers**: calling LLMs, providing prompts and parsing the response
- **Memories for LLMs**: memories to store conversations and manage limited context space
- **Chains**: creating sequences of operations
- **Question Answering over Documents**: apply LLMs to your proprietary data and use case requirements
- **Agents**: explore the powerful emerging development of LLM as reasoning agents.

At the end of the course, you will have some templates that can serve as a starting point for your own exploration of LLMs for your applications.
